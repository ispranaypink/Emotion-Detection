# Emotion-Detection
This project implements a deep learning-based emotion detection system using AlexNet CNN architecture. The model classifies human facial expressions into categories such as:
- 😊 Happy
- 😠 Angry
- 😢 Sad
- 😐 Neutral
- 😲 Surprised

The project is developed using TensorFlow/Keras and trained on a publicly available dataset  FER2013.


Features
- Image Preprocessing: Normalization, resizing, and data augmentation for better accuracy.  
- CNN Model (AlexNet): Deep learning model fine-tuned for emotion classification.  
- Dataset Handling: Trained on a labeled dataset containing facial emotion images.  
- Live Emotion Detection: Can be integrated with OpenCV for real-time classification.  
- Evaluation Metrics: Tracks accuracy, loss, and confusion matrix for performance assessment.


Technologies Used
- Deep Learning Framework: TensorFlow/Keras 
- Image Processing: OpenCV, NumPy, Matplotlib
- Dataset: FER2013 
- Development Environment: Google Colab / Jupyter Notebook
